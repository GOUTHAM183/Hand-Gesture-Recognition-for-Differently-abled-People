Our project, "Hand Gesture Recognition for differently abled people" represents a significant leap forward in the field of accessibility technology. Through the integration of cutting-edge technologies such as Python, TensorFlow, Mediapipe, and OpenCV, we have developed a sophisticated deep-learning solution that addresses the unique communication needs of differently-abled individuals.
